Destructed earth
================

A game created for [OLC codejam 2019](https://itch.io/jam/olc-codejam-2019)
with theme destruction. Source code can be found on
[Github](https://github.com/tpseitz/olcJam).

This game aims to be a remake of old game called Scorched Earth. It uses
[OLC Pixel Game Engine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
from javidx9 aka One Lone Coder, the creator of the jam.

Roadmap
=======

Here is some features that I plan to implement before the game is considered
complete. Of course most of these properties won't be implemented in the Jam
time.

* Basic UI
** shop and end screen
** player properties and menu
* Falling ground
* An actual AI
* Network play
* Particles
* Different settings for ground
* Moving weapon implementation from hard coded to Lua
* Name and quote databases
* Wind
* Natural phenomenons: thunder, meteors
* Graphics
* Sound
* Server / client possibility
