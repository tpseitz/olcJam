Oof
Aaargh!
Wait, what?
Father? Is that you?
Noo! My only friend!
Et tu, Brute?
I see the light!
Are those flames?
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur
I thought we were friends
I was getting bored after all
Beam me home, Scotty
Not like this
Ah, there's nothing like the hot winds of Hell blowing in your face
Well, that's unfortunate
Now I understand
I'm outta here
Farewell
Format my hard drives
This joke is getting a bit old
I didn't like this life anyway
*ZAP*
What's this red sticky stuff?
That smells like BBQ
Eva, ich liebe dich
*muffled cursing*
You'll pay for this
Its just a flesh wound...
Is this the end?
No regrets
Fuck this shit
Fuck!
Ouch!
I don't hate you
Son, I'm disappointed
Does not compute
EOF
NULL
Goodbye cruel world
...
Oh no!
I loved you
It's fine. Everything is fine
Shit!
Till we meet again
