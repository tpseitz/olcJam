Oof
Aaargh!
Wait, what?
Father? Is that you?
Noo! My only friend!
Et tu, Brute?
I see the light!
I see the li.. Oh wait!
See you in Hell
Are those flames?
Pardonnez-moi, monsieur
Swing low, sweet chariot
I thought we were friends
I was getting bored after all
Beam me home, Scotty
I'm your father
It hurts. Make it stop!
Not like this
Ah, there's nothing like the hot winds of Hell blowing in your face
I.. Um..
Well, that's unfortunate
I'm the king of the world!
Time to go row with the other slaves
Moo, I say
Now I understand
I'm outta here
Farewell
Format my hard drives
This joke is getting a bit old
I didn't like this life anyway
We'll see in court
*ZAP*
Is this happiness?
I see dead people
I believe I can fly
I don't like where this is going
What's this red sticky stuff?
What's that smell?
Oh snap
That smells like BBQ
Nobody loves me
NO NO NO NO!
But I'm le tired
Eva, ich liebe dich
*muffled cursing*
This is madness
You ruined my new shoes
Oh
Look at my horse, my horse is amazing
You'll pay for this
At last
Let's have a party!
Just a flesh wound...
I bite your legs off!
What? This wasn't a practice round?
Help me Ben, you're my only hope
Never mind
Is this the end?
Let's go!
Didn't like you anyway
I've found it!
To be or, not to be, that is the question
No regrets
My thoughts exactly
Fuck this shit
No hard feelings
I guess my prices is in another castle
Dude!
Fuck!
Ouch!
I don't hate you
Don't make lemonade
Freedom!
Son, I'm disappointed
Does not compute
EOF
NULL
Yes. But why?
Downstairs, please
Goodbye cruel world
Starting self destruct sequence
Why me?
...
Oh yes!
At last...
Oh no!
You make me feel very special
I loved you
<3
Ha ha! I'm using the Internet!
It's fine. Everything is fine
Victory!
It'll buff right off
Who's there?
Ha ha ha!
Shit!
Till we meet again
